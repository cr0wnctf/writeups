![Challenge description](/2018_06_23_GoogleCTF/keygenme/images/chall.png)

# TL;DR
For this challenge we were provided with a single file called `main`. The binary decrypts itself and then forks, the child decrypts the second stage and executes it, the parent rewrites the child code on the fly and the child performs verification of the flag with a modified MD5 and a transformation function.

# Long version
For this challenge we were provided with a single file called `main`.
```bash
user@re:~$ file main
main: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
```

Executing the binary we can see it reads two inputs and then exits.
```bash
user@re:~$ ./main
x
x
user@re:~$
```
Running `strace` we can get a rough idea of what the binary is doing. First it runs `ptrace` with `PTRACE_DETACH`, then it forks, then it appears to read and write to the child process via `process_vm_readv` and `process_vm_writev`. It also appears to be repeatedly getting and setting the registers of the child process with `PTRACE_GETREGS` and `PTRACE_SETREGS`.

Now lets see what's happening with the child using `strace -f`.

```
user@re:~$ strace -f ./main
execve("./main", ["./main"], [/* 54 vars */]) = 0
mmap(NULL, 65536, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0) = 0x7ffff7fea000
mmap(NULL, 65536, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0) = 0x7ffff7fda000
ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, 0, NULL, SIG_0)   = -1 ESRCH (No such process)
fork()                                  = 1359
mmap(NULL, 65536, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0) = 0x7ffff7fca000
wait4(1359, strace: Process 1359 attached

[pid  1359] read(0, x

[pid  1359] seccomp(SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER, 0, {len = 8, filter = 0x7ffff7fdde7e}) = 0
[pid  1359] ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, NULL, NULL) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
[pid  1359] memfd_create("hi", MFD_CLOEXEC) = 3
[pid  1359] write(3, "\177ELF\2\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0>\0\1\0\0\0\300\7\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 14488) = 14488

[pid  1359] execve("/proc/self/fd/3", ["x\n", "x\n"], NULL) = 0
...
```
 
This shows the child setting up a seccomp filter, creating a memfd (fd = 3), writing what appears to be an ELF file to the memfd and then executing it with `execve`. 
Lets dump the seccomp filter with `seccomp-tools` to see what filter it's enforcing.

```
user@re:~$ seccomp-tools dump ./main

 line  CODE  JT   JF      K
=================================
 0000: 0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00000004  A = arch
 0001: 0x15 0x00 0x05 0xc000003e  if (A != ARCH_X86_64) goto 0007
 0002: 0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00000000  A = sys_number
 0003: 0x35 0x03 0x00 0x40000000  if (A >= 0x40000000) goto 0007
 0004: 0x15 0x01 0x00 0x0000005f  if (A == umask) goto 0006
 0005: 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x7fff0000  return ALLOW
 0006: 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00050001  return ERRNO(1)
 0007: 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00000000  return KILL
 ```

 This shows that the `umask` syscall will return `ERRNO(1)`, which means that the `umask` syscall will always return the value `1`. Interesting.


Now we can dive into some static reversing. 

Opening it up in IDA we immediately see some form of decryption loop. `sub_400189` mmaps a 65KB region of RWX memory, then we can see the code copies 17576 bytes from address `0x6001BC` in the .data section, to the mmapped memory, after which the mmapped memory is xored with the key `0x1122334455667788`.

![Decryption loop in IDA](/2018_06_23_GoogleCTF/keygenme/images/main_1.png)

I whipped up a quick IDA script to perform this xor statically so I could continue my analysis.

```python
start = 0x6001BC
key = 0x1122334455667788
length = 17576

print("[*] XOR start: {}".format(hex(start)))
for ptr in range(start, start+length, 8): 
    PatchQword(ptr, Qword(ptr) ^ key);

Message("[*] XOR done :)\n");
```

Browsing to `0x6001BC` and marking it as code we can now see the decrypted code. 

Most of this code looks like it has been handwritten and there are various self-modifying tricks to throw us off. For example the following piece of code actually calls `ptrace` and not `exit_group`, by changing the syscall number of its own code.

![Self modification with ptrace](/2018_06_23_GoogleCTF/keygenme/images/main_2.png)


Continuing to read through and following the (somewhat obfuscated) control flow we can see the aforementioned behaviour of setting up seccomp rules, creating and writing to a memfd, and eventually executing it. The two reads performed are passed to the `execve`d process as `argv[0]` and `argv[1]`. It appears that `sub_603EEE` does the decryption of the ELF file, however its control flow was too difficult to follow, so I just stepped over it when debugging and took it as a magic black box which decrypted the ELF. 

At `0x600442` the binary writes the decrypted file to the memfd, so it was at this point that I set a breakpoint with `gdb` and dumped 14488 bytes from the decrypted address, which gave me the second stage binary.

# Second stage
```
user@re:~$ file second_stage
second_stage: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=1b6bb2a46a5e760d6de3fb5c4782e05c0a118f11, stripped
```

Opening this binary in IDA we could see some strange things going on. Specifically there appeared to be a few infinite loops, and code missing in several places, with `int 3`s replacing the missing code.

There was also some PLT trickery going on. The binary was patching its own PLT at runtime such that the PLT entry which looked to be pointing to the `exit` GOT entry actually ended up pointing to the `umask` GOT entry. This messed up some of IDAs disassembly/decompilation because what appeared to be unreachable code after the "exit" was actually perfectly reachable. To fix this I patched the PLT statically and nopped the runtime patch, which helped IDA make more sense of things. 

After giving this binary a quick skim I thought it would be more beneficial for my understanding to dump the data that was being sent back and forth between the parent and child binary, which we saw earlier in `strace`. Despite having the data already available via `strace`, in my tired and weary state I thought the best way to do this would be to write a kernel module, hook the `process_vm_readv` and `process_vm_writev` syscalls and output the data... so that is exactly what I did.

The first write and read of each "block" look very repetitive and not very interesting. However the last write does appear to be interesting with different data every time. The data didn't appear to be ASCII or the flag encoded in any way, however each piece appeared to form valid x64 instructions. Then it hit me, the parent was rewriting the child code on the fly, every time the child hit an `int 3`, the parent would be notified and would replace the `int 3`s with real instructions.

At this point I spent a while trying to dump the whole patched binary from the kernel module after the final write, however I couldn't get the file IO to work correctly for some reason. So I resorted to a more hacky technique - I grepped all of the patches and offsets out from `dmesg`, and applied them manually via Python to the previously dumped second stage.

Now we finally had the complete second stage binary and could see what it was doing. 

Some of the functions initially looked pretty heavy.

![Decryption loop in IDA](/2018_06_23_GoogleCTF/keygenme/images/second_1.png)


However after spotting some MD5 constants it soon became clear that all the bad looking functions were actually MD5, which was nice.
```c
_DWORD *__fastcall sub_16FB(_DWORD *a1)
{
  _DWORD *result; // rax

  a1[2] = 0x67452301;
  a1[3] = 0xEFCDAB89;
  a1[4] = 0x98BADCFE;
  a1[5] = 0x10325476;
  *a1 = 0;
  result = a1;
  a1[1] = 0;
  return result;
}
```

There were also some slight modifications to the MD5 algorithm which were designed to make the MD5 wrong if you executed the second stage as a standalone binary. Specifically there were two calls to `umask`, which would return 1 (due to seccomp) when run within `main`, and return something else when run outside of `main`. If the `PWD` environment variable was set it would also xor an MD5 value with the address of the environment variable. `PWD` would usually be set if the binary was executed from a shell however it wouldn't be set if executed from `main`. 


It became clear that the binary was checking whether `MD5(argv[0]) == transform(argv[1])`, where `transform` was `sub_A0E` and was taking 32 hex digits and performing some transformation. If the results matched then the we had a valid key.

# Hooking `execve`
At this point all we had to do was find a way to get the same MD5 as the binary for a given `argv[0]` and reverse the transformation, which would give us `argv[1]` for a given `MD5(argv[0])`, and we were done. The second task proved significantly easier and my teammate quickly put together a script which reversed the transformation. Unfortunately, despite `LD_PRELOAD`ing the `umask` and unsetting `PWD` we couldn't get a correct hash from running the second stage binary standalone, so we realised we were going to have to dump it from normal execution of the second stage spawned by `main`. Debugging `main` was a challenge, so instead we planned to `LD_PRELOAD` the `strcmp` in the second stage, which compared the hash and the transformed `argv[1]`, and dump the first argument to get the hash. 

We quickly remembered that the second stage is spawned with a null environment and therefore our `LD_PRELOAD` wouldn't be present. In a flurry of questionable judgement (and forgetting `/etc/ld.so.preload`) we all decided that the best way to get around this was to hook `execve` and inject the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable into the second stage, which made complete sense given we already had a kernel module with hooking functionality...

I tried to add the `execve` hook to my module code however I couldn't get it to work. While I was trying to fix this my teammate managed to come up with another novelty solution. He found https://github.com/kfiros/execmon, a process monitoring tool, which hooks `execve`, so he declared that he was simply going to patch that to inject the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable. To our surprise the whole thing worked flawlessly and we were now successfully hooking `execve`, injecting `LD_PRELOAD` and hitting our proxy `strcmp`.

The patch to hook `execve('/proc/self/fd/3')` in `execmon` follows:

Now that we could get the correct MD5 from our proxy `strcmp` for a given `argv[0]`, and we had reversed the transformation, we just had to script the whole thing up and connect it to the network service provided.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python2

from pwn import *


def prog():
    return remote('keygenme.ctfcompetition.com', 1337)

def untransform(data):
    data = unhex(data)
    out = [0] * 16
    for j in range(16):
        x = j ^ ord(data[j]) ^ (16*j)
        out[j] |= x & 0xF
        out[15-j] |= x & 0xF0
    return enhex(''.join(map(chr, out)))

def find_key(name):
    ret = ''
    with process('./main') as p:
        p.sendline(name + '0'*32)
        p.recvuntil('---') # StRcMp
        p.recvuntil('---') # str1
        p.recvuntil('--- ') # str 2 - our hash
        ret = p.recvuntil('NO!')[:-3]
    print ret
    ret = untransform(ret)
    print ret
    return ret

def main():
    with prog() as p:
        while True: # do rounds
            name = p.recvline().strip('\n')
            print name
            p.sendline(find_key(name))
            print p.recvuntil('OK\n')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Finally running this gave us the flag!

# Conclusion
This was a really fun challenge with lots of detail. We definitely took many questionable turns along the road but we still managed to solve it in the end. Thanks GoogleCTF!
